# MachineLearningModels

The above data set consists of placement data 
pertaining to  students enrolled in Jain University, Banglore. It 
includes secondary and higher secondary grades (in percentages) 
and the stream that students chose for their higher secondary 
education. The data set also includes degree specialization, degree 
type, work experience and salary offers to the students who got 
placed. 

I have applied pre-existing machine learning models to predict placement.

The models include:

  
•	Logistic Regression

•	K Nearest Neighbours

•	Random Forest Classification

Apart from the above mentioned models, Logistic Regression has also been developed from scratch 
and implemented.
In the end, the best algorithm in terms of accuracy was also found.
